{"name":"Man2pdf","tagline":"Script plug-in for OS X that will grab the manpage you request and push it to Preview so you can read it or save it as a PDF","body":"# Manpage 2 PDF\r\n\r\n![](http://i.imgur.com/1BrNhcT.png)\r\n  \r\nman2pdf is a **BASH** script that read a [`manpage`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page) and pipe it to Preview to open up so you can save it as a `PDF` for later viewing, or just easier viewing!\r\n\r\nIt works best if placed in `/usr/bin` as you can then run it from Terminal without having to use the `./` or the `sh` commands to load it up. At this point, I haven't managed to get it to install there by itself. That is currently in the feature list.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n#### Usage\r\nFire up Terminal and navigate to `/usr/bin`:\r\n````shell\r\n$ cd /usr/bin\r\n````\r\n\r\nDownload the file with **cURL**, this will require `sudo` access because it's a protected directory on OS X.\r\n````shell\r\n$ sudo curl \"https://raw.github.com/danijeljames/man2pdf/master/man2pdf.sh\" -o man2pdf.sh\r\n````\r\n\r\nNow make that file executable for later\r\n````shell\r\n$ sudo chmod +x man2pdf.sh\r\n````\r\n\r\nYou can also do this with 1 really long command in a single pass:\r\n````shell\r\n$ cd /usr/bin && sudo curl \"https://raw.github.com/danijeljames/man2pdf/master/man2pdf.sh\" -o man2pdf.sh && sudo chmod +x man2pdf.sh\r\n````\r\n\r\nThen, when you need a `manpage` written out to a more readable format, just type in the name of the article you want:\r\n````shell\r\n$ man2pdf curl\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis will pipe the contents of that page into `Preview`, which is so much clearer. And I can print it without issues!\r\n  \r\n  \r\n#### Contribution\r\nI would love to see people contribute to this. Whether it's a [bug report](https://github.com/danijeljames/man2pdf/issues/new), feature suggestion or a pull request. Any questions? Please send me a tweet to @danijeljames.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n#### Feature Implementation List\r\n 1. Automatic installer for first time use to correct directory\r\n 2. ~~Built-in ReadMe when user needs assistance in usage~~\r\n 3. Add additional functionality:\r\n\t1. Extra switch to save PDF automatically\r\n\t2. Specify location of saving PDF\r\n\t3. Switch to save file to other format\r\n\t4. Settings file that can save all settings for on-going use\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
